# AI-Enhanced-Breast-Cancer-Detection-System
This Project uses the Wisconsin (original) dataset to get the result.  
This project uses various algorithms:  
1.Classification &amp;Regression Trees (CART) 
2.Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
3.Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) 
4.K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) 
5.Random Forest (RF). 
Built a complete end-to-end ML pipeline using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, enabling efficient data preprocessing, training, validation, and testing.
