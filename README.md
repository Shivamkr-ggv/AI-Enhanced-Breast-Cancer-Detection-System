# AI-Enhanced-Breast-Cancer-Detection-System
This Project uses the Wisconsin (original) dataset to get the result.  
This project uses various algorithms:  
- Classification &amp; Regression Trees (CART). 
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN).
- Random Forest (RF). 
Built a complete end-to-end ML pipeline using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, enabling efficient data preprocessing, training, validation, and testing.
